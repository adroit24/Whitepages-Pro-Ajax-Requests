# Whitepages-Pro-Ajax-Requests

The sample contains a ASP.NET Web application with a single web page - javascript.aspx. 

To run the application, add in the API key (you can get one from http://developer.whitepages.com) and enter in a phone number in Javascript.aspx.cs.

Deploy the app and as you launch the page, click on 'Make Ajax request to find out'. This should make the Ajax request to the Web method (GetData()) implemented in Javascript.aspx.cs. An alert box should pop up with the name associated with the phone.

If you have any questions, ping me at kshah[at]whitepages[dot]com.
